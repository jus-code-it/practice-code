# Python Test Execution using unittest

This guide will walk you through running Python unit tests using the `unittest` module.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Python Test Execution guide! This folder contains Python coding examples and exercises to help you practice and improve your Python programming skills.

- The `homework` folder contains coding exercises and assignments for your practice. Feel free to work on them and test your solutions using the methods described in this guide.

- The `templates` folder contains code templates and examples to serve as a reference for different Python concepts. You can use these templates as a starting point for your own projects and experiments.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to execute your Python tests using the `unittest` module:

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_python_project.git
cd your_python_project
```

2. Run the tests
Here, you can just click the play button in the top-right corner of your IDE (or wherever the play button is) to run your tests.

3. View test results
`unittest` will run the tests and display the results in the console. You will see a summary of test pass/fail status for each test case.

If you see test failures, that means that you will need to go through your code and make sure that your code is meeting the requirements.
