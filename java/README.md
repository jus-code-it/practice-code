# Java Test Execution using JUnit 5

This guide will walk you through running Java unit tests using JUnit 5 framework.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Java Test Execution guide! This folder contains Java coding examples and exercises to help you practice and improve your Java programming skills.

- The `homework` folder contains coding exercises and assignments for your practice. Feel free to work on them and test your solutions using the methods described in this guide.

- The `templates` folder contains code templates and examples to serve as a reference for different Java concepts. You can use these templates as a starting point for your own projects and experiments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): [Installation Guide](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
2. JUnit 5: JUnit 5 is included as a dependency in this project. You don't need to install it separately.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to execute your Java tests using JUnit 5:

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_java_project.git
cd your_java_project
```
2. Build the project
If your Java project requires compilation, build it using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle).

3. Run the tests
Since you're likely using an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse), simply right-click on the test class or package and select "Run Tests."

4. View test results
The test runner will run the tests and display the results in the console. You will see a summary of test pass/fail status for each test case.
