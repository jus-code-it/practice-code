# JavaScript Test Execution using Jest

This guide will walk you through running JavaScript unit tests using Jest testing framework.

## Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript Test Execution guide! This folder contains JavaScript coding examples and exercises to help you practice and improve your JavaScript programming skills.

- The `homework` folder contains coding exercises and assignments for your practice. Feel free to work on them and test your solutions using the methods described in this guide.

- The `templates` folder contains code templates and examples to serve as a reference for different JavaScript concepts. You can use these templates as a starting point for your own projects and experiments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Node.js: [Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to execute your JavaScript tests using Jest:

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_javascript_project.git
cd your_javascript_project
```

2. Install dependencies with NPM
Install the necessary dependencies, including Jest, by running:
```
npm install jest
```

3. Update package.json
Update your project's `package.json` file to include a test script:
```
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

4. Run the tests
Execute the tests using the following npm command:
```
npm test
```

5. View test results
Jest will run the tests and display the results in the console. You will see a summary of test pass/fail status for each test case.

If you see any failures, that indicates that you need to update the JavaScript code to meet the test requirements!
